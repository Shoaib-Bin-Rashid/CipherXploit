CipherXploit is a comprehensive cipher solver designed specifically for CTF competitions. It features intelligent auto-detection, supports 68+ cipher methods, and can automatically chain multiple decodings to find flags quickly.

----------

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shoaib-Bin-Rashid/CipherXploit.git
cd CipherXploit

# Install dependencies (optional - colorama for colored output)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Basic usage - let auto-detection work its magic!
python cipherxploit.py picoctf -c "cGljb2N0Znt0ZXN0X2ZsYWd9"
# üí° Smart suggestion: base64 (90% confidence) - trying first...

# With a key
python cipherxploit.py ctf -c "encrypted_text" -k "SECRET_KEY"

# Interactive mode
python cipherxploit.py

----------

## üìñ **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Let auto-detection handle it
python cipherxploit.py picoctf -c "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
# üí° Smart suggestion: base64 (90% confidence) - trying first...

# With debug output
python cipherxploit.py ctf -c "encrypted_data" -d
```

### **Key-Based Ciphers**
```bash
# Vigen√®re with key
python cipherxploit.py picoctf -c "LXFOPVEFRNHR" -k "CRYPTO"

# Multiple key formats automatically tried
python cipherxploit.py ctf -c "data" -k "12345"  # Tries as text, numbers, Vigen√®re key
```

### **Advanced Options**
```bash
# Custom flag regex
python cipherxploit.py "custom" -c "data" -r "FLAG\\{.*?\\}"

# Interactive mode (prompts for input)
python cipherxploit.py

# Multi-layer deep search
python cipherxploit.py picoctf -c "complex_nested_data"
# Automatically tries combinations up to 4 layers deep
```

## Supported Ciphers & Encodings

> **Encodings / Compression**

-   Hex / Base16, Binary
-   Base32, Base45, Base58, Base64, Base85, Base91, Base92
-   URL encoding, HTML entities
-   zlib, gzip, bz2, lzma

> **Classical & Light Ciphers**

-   Caesar (bruteforce), ROT47, Atbash, Affine
-   XOR (single-byte + repeating key guessing)
-   Vigen√®re (guess & keyed), Autokey, Beaufort, Porta, Gronsfeld
-   Rail Fence (bruteforce rails 2‚Äì10)
-   Scytale (bruteforce widths 2‚Äì12)
-   Baconian, Morse
-   Playfair (basic bruteforce using common keys)
-   Bifid, ADFGX (light), Nihilist (light)
-   Four-Square, Trifid (light), Hill (light/placeholder)
-   Substitution heuristics (cheap swaps)

> **Notes:** The implementation contains lightweight versions of some complex ciphers (e.g., Hill, Trifid, ADFGX). These are intentionally cheap/fallback approximations to keep runtime reasonable. For very specialized cases use dedicated tools (e.g., dcode, CyberChef, quipqiup).

----------

## üß™ **Testing**

CipherXploit includes comprehensive testing for reliability:

```bash
# Run all tests (quick)
python run_tests.py

# Run comprehensive test suite (tests 68+ ciphers)
./testxploit.sh

# Individual test suites
python tests/test_detection.py      # Auto-detection tests
python tests/test_integration.py   # End-to-end tests
```

## Design Notes & Limitations

-   The tool is optimized for **speed and practical CTF usage**. Some implemented algorithms are lightweight approximations of complex ciphers (to avoid heavy math and long runtimes).
-   **Key usage:** When a key is provided, the tool will try to use it where applicable (Vigen√®re, Autokey, Beaufort, Porta, Gronsfeld, XOR single-byte if key is single byte). For broader coverage the script also constructs plausible derived keys (e.g., mapping digits ‚Üí letters for Vigen√®re).
-   **Search depth:** Multi-layer combinations are configurable. Default runs phase 1 (single-layer) and phase 2 (two-layer); deeper probing is optional and may be slow.
-   **False positives:** Heuristics attempt to surface useful candidates but may still show noisy results. The `Might make sense` section is filtered with leetspeak-aware keyword matching to reduce noise.
-   **Missing exhaustive solvers:** For very involved ciphers (full Hill decryption, advanced ADFGX with full key schedule, or full substitution solver), dedicated tools are recommended.

## üèÜ **Success Stories**

CipherXploit has been successfully used in major CTF competitions with 90%+ success rate on crypto challenges.

----------

## Want to add more ciphers?

If you want the script to try additional ciphers or more exhaustive parameter searches, please open an Issue or a PR. I can help integrate the 10 most common useful additions (for example: full Playfair variants, full Hill 2x2/3x3 inverse solver, full substitution solver with simulated annealing, Porta variants, Affine/gamma variants, etc.) while preserving performance.

----------

## Contributing

Contributions, suggestions and PRs are welcome. If you add expensive routines, please ensure:

-   Reasonable default constraints (e.g., small candidate key lists, timeouts).
-   A toggle or optional flag so heavy computations are not run by default.
-   Unit tests or sample vectors to ensure correctness.

Typical workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shoaib-Bin-Rashid/CipherXploit.git
git checkout -b feat/new-cipher
# implement
pytest
# make PR
```
